                <strong>
                  13th July 2024, I took an exam at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and
                  won 3rd place in asia. It wasn't that hard, the exam was only
                  45mins long, if I had another 10-15mins I think could've
                  gotten 2nd or even 1st.</strong

                  single round examination that was 1hr long. Medals were handed
                  out based on how much you scored. There were alot of Silver
                  and Bronze medals, but there were only a few gold medalists
                  which I was apart of.</strong
